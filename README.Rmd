# Table of contents

## 1) [Multi-omics methods overview]()
* Describe types of multi-omic methods (unsupervised and supervised methods and variable selection (yes/no))
  
## 2) [Simulation Study]()
* how does DIABLO compares with existing integrative classification schemes (Concatenation and Ensemble)
* effect of the design (connection between datasets) on the types of variables selected (correlated vs. discriminatory) and error rate

## 3) [Benchmarking]()
## 4) [Case study 1: BRCA]()
## 5) [Case study 2: Asthma]()
