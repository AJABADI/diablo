	title = {Allergen-induced early and late asthmatic responses to inhaled seasonal and perennial allergens},
	issn = {1365-2222},
	url = {http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cea.12587/abstract},
	doi = {10.1111/cea.12587},
	abstract = {Background

The allergen bronchoprovocation test ({ABP}) is a validated model to study asthma pathophysiology and response to treatments. The inhibitory effect of agents on the allergen-induced late asthmatic response ({LAR}) is a predictor of their efficacy in asthma treatment. However, it is difficult to predict the magnitude of a {LAR}, which may vary according to immune responsiveness and the type of allergen used for {ABP}.


Aim

To determine the relationship between the magnitudes of {EAR} and {LAR} in mild asthmatic subjects according to the type of allergen inhaled, and its determinants.


Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of a large database of {ABPs}, all performed with a common standardized methodology. Patients were either challenged with house-dust mites ({HDM}), animals, or pollens. {EAR} was defined as a ≥20\% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second ({FEV}1) {\textless}3h following {ABP} and {LAR} as a ≥15\% fall in {FEV}1 between 3h and 7h post {ABP}. The ratio of {EAR}\% fall in {FEV}1/{LAR} \% fall in {FEV}1 was compared between the groups of subjects according to the allergen used for {ABP}.


Results

Data from 290 subjects were analyzed: 87 had an isolated {EAR} and 203, a dual response ({EAR}+{LAR}). Dual responders had a significantly lower baseline {PC}20, a more marked fall in {FEV}1 at {EAR}, and a trend towards higher baseline sputum eosinophil percentages. The ratio of {EAR} over {LAR} was significantly lower in {HDM} compared with pollen {ABP}, indicating a larger {LAR} for a similar {EAR}. No correlations were observed between the ratio of {EAR} over {LAR} and the various parameters recorded in the different groups analyzed.


Conclusion

Different mechanisms may be involved in modulating the magnitude of the {LAR}, according to the type of allergen. {HDM} seems to induce a stronger {LAR} than pollens, animal allergens being intermediary in this regard.

	abstract = {In this study, we explored a time course of peripheral whole blood transcriptomes from kidney transplantation patients who either experienced an acute rejection episode or did not in order to better delineate the immunological and biological processes measureable in blood leukocytes that are associated with acute renal allograft rejection. Using microarrays, we generated gene expression data from 24 acute rejectors and 24 nonrejectors. We filtered the data to obtain the most unambiguous and robustly expressing probe sets and selected a subset of patients with the clearest phenotype. We then performed a data-driven exploratory analysis using data reduction and differential gene expression analysis tools in order to reveal gene expression signatures associated with acute allograft rejection. Using a template-matching algorithm, we then expanded our analysis to include time course data, identifying genes whose expression is modulated leading up to acute rejection. We have identified molecular phenotypes associated with acute renal allograft rejection, including a significantly upregulated signature of neutrophil activation and accumulation following transplant surgery that is common to both acute rejectors and nonrejectors. Our analysis shows that this expression signature appears to stabilize over time in nonrejectors but persists in patients who go on to reject the transplanted organ. In addition, we describe an expression signature characteristic of lymphocyte activity and proliferation. This lymphocyte signature is significantly downregulated in both acute rejectors and nonrejectors following surgery; however, patients who go on to reject the organ show a persistent downregulation of this signature relative to the neutrophil signature.},

	abstract = {Environmental allergens are an important cause of asthma and can contribute to loss of asthma control and exacerbations. Allergen inhalation challenge has been a useful clinical model to examine the mechanisms of allergen-induced airway responses and inflammation. Allergen bronchoconstrictor responses are the early response, which reaches a maximum within 30 min and resolves by 1–3 h, and late responses, when bronchoconstriction recurs after 3–4 h and reaches a maximum over 6–12 h. Late responses are followed by an increase in airway hyperresponsiveness. These responses occur when {IgE} on mast cells is cross-linked by an allergen, causing degranulation and the release of histamine, neutral proteases and chemotactic factors, and the production of newly formed mediators, such as cysteinyl leukotrienes and prostaglandin D2. Allergen-induced airway inflammation consists of an increase in airway eosinophils, basophils and, less consistently, neutrophils. These responses are mediated by the trafficking and activation of myeloid dendritic cells into the airways, probably as a result of the release of epithelial cell-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from type 2 helper T-cells. Allergen inhalation challenge has also been a widely used model to study potential new therapies for asthma and has an excellent negative predictive value for this purpose.

	abstract = {Motivation: A gene set test is a differential expression analysis in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power, organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group.
Results: We present {ROAST}, a statistically rigorous gene set test that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, {ROAST} uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on sample size, {ROAST} gives useful results even for experiments with minimal replication. {ROAST} allows for any experimental design that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate array weights and correlated samples. {ROAST} can be tuned for situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are actively involved in the molecular pathway. {ROAST} can test for uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to allow for prior importance. The power and size of the {ROAST} procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to that of a representative permutation method. Finally, {ROAST} is used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between human and mouse mammary stems.

	abstract = {Purpose
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, and is associated with upregulation of phospholipase A2 ({PLA}2), the enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine, producing lysophosphatidylcholine ({LPC}) and free fatty acids. {LPC} is a lipid mediator with known pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic properties, and is believed to be a critical factor in cardiovascular diseases. We postulate that asthmatic subjects have an elevated content of {LPC} in the lung lining fluids.

Methods
Eight non-asthmatic controls and seven asthmatic subjects were recruited for broncho-alveolar lavage fluids ({BALF}) collection for analysis of {LPC} by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Results
{LPC}16:0 and {LPC}18:0 were significantly elevated in the {BALF} of asthmatics with impaired lung function characteristic of moderate asthma, but not mild asthma. The increased {LPC} content in {BALF} was accompanied by increased {PLA}2 activity. Furthermore, {qRT}-{PCR} analysis of the {BALF} cell fraction indicated increased secretory {PLA}2-X ({sPLA}2-X).

Conclusions
The increased {LPC} content in the lung lining fluids is a potential critical lipid mediator in the initiation and/or progression of airway epithelial injury in asthma.},

We developed a method to perform a meta-analysis using the elastic net, a powerful and versatile approach for classification and regression. To demonstrate the utility of our method, we conducted a meta-analysis of lung cancer gene expression based on publicly available data. Using 629 samples from five data sets, we trained a multinomial classifier to distinguish between four lung cancer subtypes. Our meta-analysis-derived classifier included 58 genes and achieved 91\% accuracy on leave-one-study-out cross-validation and on three independent data sets. Our method makes meta-analysis of gene expression more systematic and expands the range of questions that a meta-analysis can be used to address. As the amount of publicly available gene expression data continues to grow, our method will be an effective tool to help distill these data into knowledge.},

	abstract = {Objective: It is not yet resolved how lifestyle factors and intermediate phenotypes interrelate with metabolic pathways. We aimed to investigate the associations between diet, physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and obesity with serum metabolite networks in a population-based study.
Methods: The present study included 2380 participants of a randomly drawn subcohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam. Targeted metabolomics was used to measure 127 serum metabolites. Additional data were available including anthropometric measurements, dietary assessment including intake of whole-grain bread, coffee and cake and cookies by food frequency questionnaire, and objectively measured physical activity energy expenditure and cardiorespiratory fitness in a subsample of 100 participants. In a data-driven approach, Gaussian graphical modeling was used to draw metabolite networks and depict relevant associations between exposures and serum metabolites. In addition, the relationship of different exposure metabolite networks was estimated.
Results: In the serum metabolite network, the different metabolite classes could be separated. There was a big group of phospholipids and acylcarnitines, a group of amino acids and C6-sugar. Amino acids were particularly positively associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity. C6-sugar and acylcarnitines were positively associated with obesity and inversely with intake of whole-grain bread. Phospholipids showed opposite associations with obesity and coffee intake. Metabolite networks of coffee intake and obesity were strongly inversely correlated (body mass index ({BMI}): r=−0.57 and waist circumference: r=−0.59). A strong positive correlation was observed between metabolite networks of {BMI} and waist circumference (r=0.99), as well as the metabolite networks of cake and cookie intake with cardiorespiratory fitness and intake of whole-grain bread (r=0.52 and r=0.50; respectively).
Conclusions: Lifestyle factors and phenotypes seem to interrelate in various metabolic pathways. A possible protective effect of coffee could be mediated via counterbalance of pathways of obesity involving hepatic phospholipids. Experimental studies should validate the biological mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Sleep restriction and circadian clock disruption are associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. The metabolic pathways involved in human sleep, however, have yet to be investigated with the use of a metabolomics approach. Here we have used untargeted and targeted liquid chromatography ({LC})/{MS} metabolomics to examine the effect of acute sleep deprivation on plasma metabolite rhythms. Twelve healthy young male subjects remained in controlled laboratory conditions with respect to environmental light, sleep, meals, and posture during a 24-h wake/sleep cycle, followed by 24 h of wakefulness. Two-hourly plasma samples collected over the 48 h period were analyzed by {LC}/{MS}. Principal component analysis revealed a clear time of day variation with a significant cosine fit during the wake/sleep cycle and during 24 h of wakefulness in untargeted and targeted analysis. Of 171 metabolites quantified, daily rhythms were observed in the majority (n = 109), with 78 of these maintaining their rhythmicity during 24 h of wakefulness, most with reduced amplitude (n = 66). During sleep deprivation, 27 metabolites (tryptophan, serotonin, taurine, 8 acylcarnitines, 13 glycerophospholipids, and 3 sphingolipids) exhibited significantly increased levels compared with during sleep. The increased levels of serotonin, tryptophan, and taurine may explain the antidepressive effect of acute sleep deprivation and deserve further study. This report, to our knowledge the first of metabolic profiling during sleep and sleep deprivation and characterization of 24 h rhythms under these conditions, offers a novel view of human sleep/wake regulation.},

Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure ({CAMERA}) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. {CAMERA} is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that {CAMERA} recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. {CAMERA} can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Interleukin-5 ({IL}-5) is essential for the formation of eosinophils, which are thought to have a major role in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic diseases. We aimed to assess the effects of monoclonal antibody to {IL}-5 on blood and sputum eosinophils, airway hyperresponsiveness, and the late asthmatic reaction to inhaled allergen in patients with mild asthma.
Methods
We did a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial, in which a single intravenous infusion of humanised ({IgG}-k) monoclonal antibody to {IL}-5 ({SB}-240563) was given at doses of 2·5 mg/kg (n=8) or 10·0 mg/kg (n=8). The effects of treatment on responses to inhaled allergen challenge, sputum eosinophils, and airway hyper-responsiveness to histamine were measured at weeks 1 and 4 with monitoring of blood eosinophil counts for up to 16 weeks.
Findings
Monoclonal antibody against {IL}-5 lowered the mean blood eosinophil count at day 29 from 0·25x109/L (95\% {CI} 0·16-0·34) in the placebo group to 0·04x109/L (0·00-0·07) in the 10 mg/kg group (p\&lt;0·0001), and prevented the blood eosinophilia that follows allergen challenge. After inhaled allergen challenge, 9 days after treatment, the percentage sputum eosinophils were 12·2\% in the placebo group and lowered to 0·9\% (−1·2 to 3·0; p=0·0076) in the 10 mg/kg group, and this effect persisted at day 30 after the dose. There was no significant effect of monoclonal antibody to {IL}-5 on the late asthmatic response or on airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine.
Interpretation
A single dose of monoclonal antibody to {IL}-5 decreased blood eosinophils for up to 16 weeks and sputum eosinophils at 4 weeks, which has considerable therapeutic potential for asthma and allergy. However, our findings question the role of eosinophils in mediating the late asthmatic response and causing airway hyper-responsiveness.},

	abstract = {Allergen-specific {IgE} plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. Although there has been increasing evidence suggesting the involvement of {IL}-17 in the disease, the relationship between {IL}-17 and {IgE}-mediated asthmatic responses has not yet been defined. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the contribution of {IL}-17 to an {IgE}-mediated late-phase asthmatic response and airway hyperresponsiveness ({AHR}). {BALB}/c mice passively sensitized with an {OVA}-specific {IgE} {mAb} were challenged with {OVA} intratracheally four times. The fourth challenge caused a late-phase increase in airway resistance associated with elevated levels of {IL}-17+{CD}4+ cells in the lungs. Multiple treatments with a C3a receptor antagonist or anti-C3a {mAb} during the challenges inhibited the increase in {IL}-17+{CD}4+ cells. Meanwhile, a single treatment with the antagonist or the {mAb} at the fourth challenge suppressed the late-phase increase in airway resistance, {AHR}, and infiltration by neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Because {IL}-17 production in the lungs was significantly repressed by both treatments, the effect of an anti–{IL}-17 {mAb} was examined. The late-phase increase in airway resistance, {AHR}, and infiltration by neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was inhibited. Furthermore, an anti–Gr-1 {mAb} had a similar effect. Collectively, we found that {IgE} mediated the increase of {IL}-17+{CD}4+ cells in the lungs caused by repeated Ag challenges via C3a. The mechanisms leading to the {IgE}-mediated late-phase asthmatic response and {AHR} are closely associated with neutrophilic inflammation through the production of {IL}-17 induced by C3a.},

	abstract = {Background
{IL}-25 is thought to participate in allergic inflammation by propagating Th2-type responses.
Objective
To address the hypothesis that allergen provocation increases expression of {IL}-25 and its receptor {IL}-25R in the asthmatic bronchial mucosa and skin dermis of atopic subjects.
Methods
Sequential single and double immunostaining was used to evaluate the numbers and phenotypes of {IL}-25 and {IL}-25R immunoreactive cells in bronchial biopsies from mild atopic subjects with asthma (n = 10) before and 24 hours after allergen inhalation challenge and skin biopsies from atopic subjects (n = 10) up to 72 hours after allergen subepidermal injection.
Results
{IL}-25 immunoreactivity was expressed by a majority of epidermal cells in both organs at baseline and was not further augmented by challenge. {IL}-25R immunoreactive cells were rare in the epidermis before or after challenge. Allergen challenge was associated with significantly (P \&lt; .01) increased expression of {IL}-25 and {IL}-25R immunoreactivity in the submucosa of both organs. {IL}-25 immunoreactivity colocalized with eosinophils, mast cells, and endothelial cells, whereas {IL}-25R immunoreactivity colocalized with eosinophils, mast cells, endothelial cells, and T lymphocytes. In both organs, correlations were observed between increases in {IL}-25 expression and the magnitudes of the late-phase allergen-induced clinical responses.
Conclusion
Allergen provocation induces functionally relevant, increased expression of {IL}-25 and its receptor in the asthmatic bronchial mucosa and dermis of sensitized atopic subjects. In addition to T cells, eosinophils, mast cells, and endothelial cells are potential sources and targets of {IL}-25 in the course of allergic inflammation.},

Drug was administered on Days 1 and 8, and allergen challenges were performed on Days 14 and 35. The primary outcome variable was the late-phase area under the curve ({AUC}), and secondary outcome variables were the early- and late-phase maximum percent fall in {FEV}1, early {AUC}, allergen-induced shift in airway hyperresponsiveness, and sputum eosinophils.Measurements and Main Results: The treatment difference with {IMA}-638 on Day 14 was −19.1 {FEV}1 × hour (95\% confidence interval: −36.2, −1.9) for the allergen-induced early {AUC} and −23.8 {FEV}1 × hour (95\% confidence interval: −46.4, −1.2) for the late {AUC} (both P {\textless} 0.05), but this effect was lost by Day 35.

We found that treatment with {rhuMAb}-E25 reduced serum {IgE}, increased the dose of allergen needed to provoke an early asthmatic response, reduced the mean maximal fall in {FEV}1 during the early response (30 +/- 10\% at baseline to 18.8 +/- 8\%, versus 33 +/- 8\% at baseline to 34 +/- 4\% after placebo; p = 0.01), and reduced the mean maximal fall in {FEV}1 during the late response (24 +/- 20\% at baseline to 9 +/- 10\% versus 20 +/- 17\% at baseline to 18 +/- 17\% after placebo; p = 0.047).

	abstract = {Summary
Asthma is a common heterogeneous disease with a complex pathophysiology. Current therapies based on inhaled corticosteroids and longacting β2 agonists are effective in controlling asthma in most, but not all patients, with a few patients falling into the severe asthma category. Severe asthma is characterised by poor asthma control, recurrent exacerbations, and chronic airflow obstruction despite adequate and, in many cases, high-dose treatments. There is strong evidence supporting the role for interleukins derived from T-helper-2 (Th2) cells and innate lymphoid cells, such as interleukins 4, 5, and 13, as underlying the eosinophilic and allergic inflammatory processes in nearly half of these patients. An anti-{IgE} antibody, omalizumab, which binds to circulating {IgE}, a product of B cells from the actions of interleukin 4 and interleukin 13, is used as treatment for severe allergic asthma. Studies examining cytokine blockers such as anti-interleukin-5, anti-interleukin-4Rα, and anti-interleukin-13 monoclonal antibodies in patients with severe asthma with recurrent exacerbations and high blood eosinophil counts despite use of inhaled corticosteroids have reported improved outcomes in terms of exacerbations, asthma control, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s. The {US} Food and Drug Administration's recommendation to use an anti-interleukin-5 antibody for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma suggests that there will be a therapeutic place for these anti-Th2 agents. Biomarkers should be used to identify the right patients for such targeted approaches. More guidance will be needed as to which patients should receive each of these classes of selective antibody-based treatments. Currently, there is no treatment that targets the cytokines driving asthma associated with non-eosinophilic inflammation and low Th2 expression.},

	abstract = {Asthma may represent the clinical manifestations of a unique form of chronic airway Inflammation and is often associated with allergy. To better define the components of allergic inflammation in the lung, fluids obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage ({BAL}) were examined for cells, inflammatory mediators, and markers of airway permeability 5 min and 19 h following instillation of ragweed antigen directly into an airway segment of allergic asthmatic subjects. The 5-min response to antigen challenge (n = 10) was characterized by 17- to 208-fold increases in histamine, prostaglandin D2 ({PGD}2), and its metabolite, 9α,11β-{PGF}2, thromboxane B2, and 6-keto-{PGF}1α compared with a saline-challenged segment (0.004 {\textless} p {\textless} 0.017). The increases in most of these mediators were significantly correlated with each other (0.0001 {\textless} p ⩽ 0.01), and the magnitude of all significant mediator increases was directly correlated with skin test sensitivity to ragweed antigen (0.007 ⩽ p ⩽ 0.05). There was also a slight increase in kinins (p = 0.04). Changes in cells and airway permeability were not detected. In contrast, the 19-h response to antigen challenge (n = 9) was characterized by a 13-fold increase in total cells recovered by {BAL}. Eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes were significantly increased and comprised 38, 1, and 9\% of total cells, respectively. A neutrophll influx was also observed but was not specific for antigen challenge since a similar change was observed in a sham, saline-challenged site. Hlstamine and {PGD}2 remained elevated in the 19-h response (p {\textless} 0.05), but levels were much lower than in the 5-min response. The profile of other prostanoid mediators was also reversed in the 19-h versus 5-min response, with only {PGE}2 and {PGF}2α increased in the later response (p {\textless} 0.05). Albumin and urea, used as markers of airway permeability, were increased 20- and 6-fold, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05). Kinins increased 8-fold (p {\textless} 0.01). As in the 5-min response, skin test sensitivity was directly correlated with certain mediator (histamine, {PGD}2, {PGE}2, {PGF}2α, and kinins) and cellular changes (eosinophils) in the 19-h response to antigen (0.01 {\textless} p {\textless} 0.05). These findings demonstrate that allergic inflammation in the lung is initiated by the release of multiple inflammatory mediators dominated by products derived from mast cells. However, the profile of released mediators suggests the early involvement of many other cell types in the immediate response. Subsequent inflammatory changes include the continued production of mediators, exudation of plasma proteins, and the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes. Since many of these changes are characteristic of asthma, these findings support a role for allergic inflammation in the pathogenesis of this disease.},

	abstract = {Background Some patients with asthma who are allergic to cats and are injected intradermally with short, overlapping, T-cell peptides derived from Fel d 1 develop late asthmatic reactions to the peptides, which are associated with a reduction in late-phase skin reactions induced by whole allergens and bronchial hyporesponsiveness to the peptides on the second injection. We aimed to ascertain the effect of multiple injections on the magnitude of the early and late phase skin reactions to intact allergens. Methods After a 9-week run-in period, we randomly assigned patients with asthma and allergies to cats to receive either Fel d 1 peptides (90 mug in increasing divided doses) or placebo. The primary outcome was late-phase cutaneous reactions to whole cat dander. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 4-8 weeks, and 3-9 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings 16 patients were randomly assigned to the peptides, and eight to placebo. All patients completed the course of injections. Four of the 16 patients on Fel d 1 peptides had initial late asthmatic reactions, but could be desensitised to the higher dose of peptide. Patients in the peptide group but not the placebo group had a significant reduction in the size of their late reaction to whole cat dander between baseline and both follow-ups, but the difference between groups was not significant (first follow-up, difference -422.8 mm(2) [95\% Cl -1115.0 to 269.4], p=0.43; second follow-up -1180.8 mm(2) [-2216.8 to -144-8], p=0.058). The size of the late reaction to Fel d 1 significantly differed between treatment groups at both follow-ups. At second follow-up, the size of the early reaction to Fel D 1, but not to whole cat dander was significantly reduced in those on peptides compared with those on placebo. The concentration of interferon gamma and of interleukin 4 and 13, and the amount of proliferation, significantly decreased between baseline and second follow-up, and the concentration of interleukin 10 was significantly higher in patients on peptides, however, none of these values differed significantly between groups. Patients on peptides had a significantly greater decrease in the concentration of interferon gamma and interleukin 13, and in the amount of proliferation between baseline and first follow-up than did those on placebo. Interpretation Several, short, overlapping Fel d I T-cell peptides have potential in treatment of cat allergy.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2466-14-166},
	abstract = {Background: Inhaled allergen challenge is a standard method to study airway responses to inflammatory provocation and evaluate the therapeutic potential of novel anti-inflammatory compounds in asthma. {MEM} 1414 is a novel oral {PDE}4 inhibitor with high affinity and selectivity creating the potential for an improved side effect profile vs non-selective {PDE} inhibitors. We evaluated the tolerability and effect of {MEM} 1414 on airway responses in mild asthmatics. Methods: A randomised double blind placebo controlled cross over study in two centres, in which sixteen steroid naive atopic asthmatics were challenged with inhaled allergen. Subjects were dosed with {MEM} 1414 (600 mg) or placebo, twice daily orally for 7 days. Allergen challenge was performed on day 6 (2 hours post-dose), and methacholine responsiveness was measured 24 hours post allergen (day 7). Biomarkers of drug effects using ex vivo {LPS} stimulation of whole blood production of interleukin ({IL})-6 and leukotriene ({LT})-B4 and fractional exhaled nitric oxide ({FeNO}) were measured on day 6 (0, 2 and 8 hours post-dose). Plasma pharmacokinetics were measured on days 1, 6 and 7. The primary endpoint was the effect on late asthmatic response to allergen. Results: Treatment with {MEM} 1414 abrogated the late phase response with a mean difference in {FEV}1 ({LAR} 3-10 hours) of 104 ml (25\%) vs placebo (p {\textless} 0.005), with no effect on the early response. Biomarker responses were also attenuated with {MEM} 1414 treatment with reductions in {LPS}-stimulated whole blood assays for {TNF} alpha at 8 hours (p {\textless} 0.03) and {LTB}4 at 24 hours (p = 0.0808) with no change in the {IL}-6 response. The {MEM} 1414 treatment phase was associated with higher incidence of nausea (6/16 {MEM} 1414 vs 2/16 placebo) and vomiting (3/16 vs 0/16 placebo). Conclusions: Oral {MEM} 1414, a novel {PDE}4 inhibitor, significantly reduces the late response following inhaled allergen challenge. {MEM} 1414 also inhibited whole blood assays of cytokine production from inflammatory cells. {MEM} 1414 was associated with a typical adverse event profile of {PDE}4 inhibitors, namely nausea and vomiting although these were mild side effects.},

In this protocol we describe the use of the Trinity platform for de novo transcriptome assembly from {RNA}-seq data in non-model organisms. We also present Trinity-supported companion utilities for downstream applications, including {RSEM} for transcript abundance estimation, R/Bioconductor packages for identifying differentially expressed transcripts across samples and approaches to identify protein-coding genes. In the procedure, we provide a workflow for genome-independent transcriptome analysis leveraging the Trinity platform. The software, documentation and demonstrations are freely available from http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net.

	abstract = {Aims
The pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ({HFPEF}) is not fully understood. A recently proposed mechanism for {HFPEF} is that it is a systemic pro-inflammatory state induced by comorbidities, leading to microvascular endothelial dysfunction and subsequent cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. We hypothesize that targeting comorbidities will improve outcomes in elderly patients with {HFPEF}. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine whether the combination of systematic screening and optimal management of prespecified comorbidities associated with {HFPEF} improves outcomes.
Methods
This multicenter, prospective, randomized intervention trial uses an open procedure with blinded endpoint assessment. Patients with {HFPEF} aged {\textgreater}60 years (n = 360) will be randomized 1:1 to the usual care or intervention arm of the trial. When randomized to the intervention arm, all patients will be systematically screened and optimally treated for the most frequent cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, and renal comorbidities. The primary endpoint is a composite clinical score that classifies each randomized patient as improved or deteriorated based on objective and subjective data at a 24-month follow-up performed by a blinded endpoint committee.
Conclusion
Rather than targeting cardiac dysfunction, our study aims to present evidence for a possible paradigm shift in the management of {HFPEF}. Our novel concept focuses on the management of comorbidities as predisposing factors in {HFPEF}.},

	doi = {10.1093/infdis/jiv178},
	abstract = {Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a common pathogen in microvascular disease and cardiomyopathy, owing to infection of endothelial cells. B19V replication, however, is almost restricted to erythroid progenitor cells ({ErPCs}). Endothelial regeneration attributable to bone marrow-derived circulating angiogenic cells ({CACs}) is a prerequisite for organ function. Because of many similarities of {ErPCs} and {CACs}, we hypothesized that B19V is a perpetrator of impaired endogenous endothelial regeneration. B19V {DNA} and messenger {RNA} from endomyocardial biopsy specimens, bone marrow specimens, and circulating progenitor cells were quantified by polymerase chain reaction analysis. The highest B19V {DNA} concentrations were found in {CD}34(+){KDR}(+) cells from 17 patients with chronic B19V-associated cardiomyopathy. B19V replication intermediates could be detected in nearly half of the patients. Furthermore, chronic B19V infection was associated with impaired endothelial regenerative capacity. B19V infection of {CACs} in vitro resulted in expression of transcripts encoding B19V proteins. The capsid protein {VP}1 was identified as a novel inducer of apoptosis, as were nonstructural proteins. Inhibition studies identified so-called death receptor signaling with activation of caspase-8 and caspase-10 to be responsible for apoptosis induction. B19V causally impaired endothelial regeneration with spreading of B19V in {CACs} in an animal model in vivo. We thus conclude that B19V infection and damage to {CACs} result in dysfunctional endogenous vascular repair, supporting the emergence of primary bone marrow disease with secondary end-organ damage.},

{BACKGROUND}: Influenza is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure.
{METHODS}: We used data from the {PARADIGM}-{HF} trial in which patients with heart failure were randomized to the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor {LCZ}696 (sacubitril/valsartan) or enalapril. We assessed predictors of receiving influenza vaccination, and examined the relationship between influenza vaccination and outcomes in a propensity-adjusted model.
{RESULTS}: Of 8,099 study participants, 1,769 (21\%) received influenza vaccination. We observed significant regional variation in vaccination rates, with highest rates in the Netherlands (77.5\%), Great Britain (77.2\%), and Belgium (67.5\%), and lowest rates in Asia (2.6\%), with intermediate rates in North America (52.8\%). Top predictors of vaccination included enrolling country, white race, implanted defibrillator, older age, lower New York Heart Association functional class, lower heart rate, and a history of diabetes mellitus. Influenza vaccination was associated with a reduced risk for all-cause mortality in propensity-adjusted (hazard ratio: 0.81; 95\% confidence interval: 0.67 to 0.97; p = 0.015) models.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Influenza vaccination rates varied widely in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction enrolled in the {PARADIGM}-{HF} trial, and vaccination was associated with reduced risk for death, although whether this association was causal cannot be determined.},

	abstract = {Interferon-α ({IFN}-α) is essential for antiviral immunity, but in the absence of matrix metalloproteinase-12 ({MMP}-12) or {IκBα} (encoded by {NFKBIA}) we show that {IFN}-α is retained in the cytosol of virus-infected cells and is not secreted. Our findings suggest that activated {IκBα} mediates the export of {IFN}-α from virus-infected cells and that the inability of cells in Mmp12(-/-) but not wild-type mice to express {IκBα} and thus export {IFN}-α makes coxsackievirus type B3 infection lethal and renders respiratory syncytial virus more pathogenic. We show here that after macrophage secretion, {MMP}-12 is transported into virus-infected cells. In {HeLa} cells {MMP}-12 is also translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to the {NFKBIA} promoter, driving transcription. We also identified dual-regulated substrates that are repressed both by {MMP}-12 binding to the substrate's gene exons and by {MMP}-12-mediated cleavage of the substrate protein itself. Whereas intracellular {MMP}-12 mediates {NFKBIA} transcription, leading to {IFN}-α secretion and host protection, extracellular {MMP}-12 cleaves off the {IFN}-α receptor 2 binding site of systemic {IFN}-α, preventing an unchecked immune response. Consistent with an unexpected role for {MMP}-12 in clearing systemic {IFN}-α, treatment of coxsackievirus type B3-infected wild-type mice with a membrane-impermeable {MMP}-12 inhibitor elevates systemic {IFN}-α levels and reduces viral replication in pancreas while sparing intracellular {MMP}-12. These findings suggest that inhibiting extracellular {MMP}-12 could be a new avenue for the development of antiviral treatments.},

Each of these metabolic abnormalities is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with {HF}; however, their detection and therapeutic management remains challenging. Given the difficulty in obtaining human cardiac tissue for research purposes, peripheral blood metabolomic profiling, a well-established approach for characterizing small-molecule metabolite intermediates from canonical biochemical pathways, may be a useful technology for dissecting biomarkers and mechanisms of metabolic impairment in {HF}.

	abstract = {Insensitivity and technical complexity have impeded the implementation of high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing in differential diagnosis of viral infections in clinical laboratories. Here, we describe the development of a virome capture sequencing platform for vertebrate viruses ({VirCapSeq}-{VERT}) that increases the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and characterization. The system uses {\textasciitilde}2 million probes that cover the genomes of members of the 207 viral taxa known to infect vertebrates, including humans. A biotinylated oligonucleotide library was synthesized on the {NimbleGen} cleavable array platform and used for solution-based capture of viral nucleic acids present in complex samples containing variable proportions of viral and host nucleic acids. The use of {VirCapSeq}-{VERT} resulted in a 100- to 10,000-fold increase in viral reads from blood and tissue homogenates compared to conventional Illumina sequencing using established virus enrichment procedures, including filtration, nuclease treatments, and {RiboZero} {rRNA} subtraction. {VirCapSeq}-{VERT} had a limit of detection comparable to that of agent-specific real-time {PCR} in serum, blood, and tissue extracts. Furthermore, the method identified novel viruses whose genomes were approximately 40\% different from the known virus genomes used for designing the probe library. The {VirCapSeq}-{VERT} platform is ideally suited for analyses of virome composition and dynamics.
Importance {VirCapSeq}-{VERT} enables detection of viral sequences in complex sample backgrounds, including those found in clinical specimens, such as serum, blood, and tissue. The highly multiplexed nature of the system allows both the simultaneous identification and the comprehensive genetic characterization of all known vertebrate viruses, their genetic variants, and novel viruses. The operational simplicity and efficiency of the {VirCapSeq}-{VERT} platform may facilitate transition of high-throughput sequencing to clinical diagnostic as well as research applications.},

However, the underlying mechanisms for this synergy remain unclear. Here we show, utilizing bone marrow-derived mast cells ({BMMCs}) from Btk and Lyn knock-out mice, that activation of Btk via Lyn plays a key role in promoting synergy. As in human mast cells, {SCF} enhanced degranulation and cytokine production in {BMMCs}. In Btk-/- {BMMCs}, in which there was a partial reduction in the capacity to degranulate in response to antigen, {SCF} was unable to enhance the residual antigen-mediated degranulation. Furthermore, as with antigen, the ability of {SCF} to promote cytokine production was abrogated in the Btk-/- {BMMCs}. The impairment of responses in Btk-/- cells correlated with an inability of {SCF} to augment phospholipase Cγ1 activation and calcium mobilization, and to phosphorylate {NFκB} and {NFAT} for cytokine gene transcription in these cells. Similar studies with Lyn-/- and Btk-/-/Lyn-/- {BMMCs} indicated that Lyn was a regulator of Btk for these responses. These data demonstrate, for the first time, that Btk is a key regulator of a Kit-mediated amplification pathway that augments {FcϵRI}-mediated mast cell activation.},

	abstract = {Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is expressed in B-lymphocytes. Mutations in Btk cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans. However, the mechanism of activation and signaling of this enzyme has not been fully investigated. We have here shown that the peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase ({PPIase}) Pin1 is a negative regulator of Btk, controlling its expression level by reducing its half-life, whereas the catalytic activity of Btk was unaffected. The negative regulatory effect of Pin1 was observed both in cell lines and in Pin-/- mice and was found to be dependent on a functionally intact Btk. This may constitute a feedback loop for the regulation of Btk. The target region in Btk was localized to the pleckstrin homology domain suggesting that interphase phosphorylation of serine 115 (Ser-115) in Btk is required, whereas mitosis phosphorylation of serine 21 (Ser-21) is critical. Accordingly, Pin 1 was shown to associate with Btk through binding to Ser-21 and -115, respectively, both of which lie in a classical Pin1-binding pocket. Using a phosphomitotic antibody, it was found that Btk harbors a bona fide {MPM}2 epitope corresponding to a phosphorylated serine or threonine residue followed by a proline. Our results indicate that the peptidylprolyl isomerase Pin1 interacts with Btk in a cell cycle-dependent manner, regulating the Btk expression level.},

Deregulation of the {PI}3K/Akt/{mTOR} signaling pathway occurs commonly in cancer and numerous inhibitors targeting the {ATP}-binding site of these kinases are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Here, we report the characterization of Torin2, a second-generation {ATP}-competitive inhibitor that is potent and selective for {mTOR} with a superior pharmacokinetic profile to previous inhibitors. Torin2 inhibited {mTORC}1-dependent T389 phosphorylation on S6K ({RPS}6KB1) with an {EC}50 of 250 pmol/L with approximately 800-fold selectivity for cellular {mTOR} versus phosphoinositide 3-kinase ({PI}3K). Torin2 also exhibited potent biochemical and cellular activity against phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase–like kinase ({PIKK}) family kinases including {ATM} ({EC}50, 28 nmol/L), {ATR} ({EC}50, 35 nmol/L), and {DNA}-{PK} ({EC}50, 118 nmol/L; {PRKDC}), the inhibition of which sensitized cells to Irradiation. Similar to the earlier generation compound Torin1 and in contrast to other reported {mTOR} inhibitors, Torin2 inhibited {mTOR} kinase and {mTORC}1 signaling activities in a sustained manner suggestive of a slow dissociation from the kinase. Cancer cell treatment with Torin2 for 24 hours resulted in a prolonged block in negative feedback and consequent T308 phosphorylation on Akt. These effects were associated with strong growth inhibition in vitro. Single-agent treatment with Torin2 in vivo did not yield significant efficacy against {KRAS}-driven lung tumors, but the combination of Torin2 with mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal–regulated kinase ({MEK}) inhibitor {AZD}6244 yielded a significant growth inhibition. Taken together, our findings establish Torin2 as a strong candidate for clinical evaluation in a broad number of oncologic settings where {mTOR} signaling has a pathogenic role.

	abstract = {Background and objective

The mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) signalling pathway regulates immune responses, and promotes cell growth and differentiation. Inhibition of {mTOR} with rapamycin modulates allergic asthma, while the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that rapamycin, effectively inhibits eosinophil differentiation, contributing to its overall protective role in allergic airway inflammation.


Methods

Rapamycin was administered in a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced allergic airway inflammation, and the eosinophil differentiation was analysed in vivo and in vitro.


Results

Rapamycin significantly attenuated allergic airway inflammation and markedly decreased the amount of eosinophils in local airways, peripheral blood and bone marrow, independently of levels of interleukin-5 ({IL}-5). In vitro colony forming unit assay and liquid culture demonstrated that rapamycin directly inhibited {IL}-5-induced eosinophil differentiation. In addition, rapamycin reduced the production of {IL}-6 and {IL}-13 by eosinophils. Rapamycin was also capable of reducing the eosinophil levels in {IL}-5 transgenic {NJ}.1638 mice, again regardless of the constitutive high levels of {IL}-5. Interestingly, rapamycin inhibition of eosinophil differentiation in turn resulted in an accumulation of eosinophil lineage-committed progenitors in bone marrow.


Conclusions

Altogether these results clearly demonstrate a direct inhibitory role of rapamycin in eosinophil differentiation and function, and reemphasize the importance of rapamycin and possibly, {mTOR}, in allergic airway disease.},

	abstract = {Vascular endothelial growth factor ({VEGF}) is supposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic airway disease. {VEGF} expression is regulated by a variety of stimuli such as nitric oxide, growth factors, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha ({HIF}-1α). Recently, inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) has been shown to alleviate cardinal asthmatic features, including airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophilic inflammation, and increased vascular permeability in asthma models. Based on these observations, we have investigated whether {mTOR} is associated with {HIF}-1α-mediated {VEGF} expression in allergic asthma. In studies with the {mTOR} inhibitor rapamycin, we have elucidated the stimulatory role of a {mTOR}-{HIF}-1α-{VEGF} axis in allergic response. Next, the mechanisms by which {mTOR} is activated to modulate this response have been evaluated. {mTOR} is known to be regulated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase ({PI}3K)/Akt or protein kinase C-delta ({PKC} δ) in various cell types. Consistent with these, our results have revealed that suppression of {PKC} δ by rottlerin leads to the inhibition of {PI}3K/Akt activity and the subsequent blockade of a {mTOR}-{HIF}-1α-{VEGF} module, thereby attenuating typical asthmatic attack in a murine model. Thus, the present data indicate that {PKC} δ is necessary for the modulation of the {PI}3K/Akt/{mTOR} signaling cascade, resulting in a tight regulation of {HIF}-1α activity and {VEGF} expression. In conclusion, {PKC} δ may represent a valuable target for innovative therapeutic treatment of allergic airway disease.},

Our lab previously demonstrated that inhibition of {mTOR} with rapamycin prevented house dust mite ({HDM})-induced allergic asthma in mice. Here, we utilized two treatment protocols to investigate whether rapamycin, compared to the steroid, dexamethasone, could inhibit allergic responses during the later stages of the disease process, namely allergen re-exposure and/or during progression of chronic allergic disease. In protocol 1, {BALB}/c mice were sensitized to {HDM} (three i.p. injections) and administered two intranasal {HDM} exposures. After 6 weeks of rest/recovery, mice were re-exposed to {HDM} while being treated with rapamycin or dexamethasone. In protocol 2, mice were exposed to {HDM} for 3 or 6 weeks and treated with rapamycin or dexamethasone during weeks 4–6. Characteristic features of allergic asthma, including {IgE}, goblet cells, airway hyperreactivity ({AHR}), inflammatory cells, cytokines/chemokines, and T cell responses were assessed. In protocol 1, both rapamycin and dexamethasone suppressed goblet cells and total {CD}4 +  T cells including activated, effector, and regulatory T cells in the lung tissue, with no effect on {AHR} or total inflammatory cell numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Rapamycin also suppressed {IgE}, although {IL}-4 and eotaxin 1 levels were augmented. In protocol 2, both drugs suppressed total {CD}4 +  T cells, including activated, effector, and regulatory T cells and {IgE} levels. {IL}-4, eotaxin, and inflammatory cell numbers were increased after rapamycin and no effect on {AHR} was observed. Dexamethasone suppressed inflammatory cell numbers, especially eosinophils, but had limited effects on {AHR}. We conclude that while {mTOR} signaling is critical during the early phases of allergic asthma, its role is much more limited once disease is established.},

	abstract = {The mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) modulates immune responses and cellular proliferation. The objective of this study was to assess whether inhibition of {mTOR} with rapamycin modifies disease severity in two experimental murine models of house dust mite ({HDM})-induced asthma. In an induction model, rapamycin was administered to {BALB}/c mice coincident with nasal {HDM} challenges for 3 weeks. In a treatment model, nasal {HDM} challenges were performed for 6 weeks and rapamycin treatment was administered during weeks 4 through 6. In the induction model, rapamycin significantly attenuated airway inflammation, airway hyperreactivity ({AHR}) and goblet cell hyperplasia. In contrast, treatment of established {HDM}-induced asthma with rapamycin exacerbated {AHR} and airway inflammation, whereas goblet cell hyperplasia was not modified. Phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein, which is downstream of {mTORC}1, was increased after 3 weeks, but not 6 weeks of {HDM}-challenge. Rapamycin reduced S6 phosphorylation in {HDM}-challenged mice in both the induction and treatment models. Thus, the paradoxical effects of rapamycin on asthma severity paralleled the activation of {mTOR} signaling. Lastly, mediastinal lymph node re-stimulation experiments showed that treatment of rapamycin-naive T cells with  ex vivo  rapamycin decreased antigen-specific Th2 cytokine production, whereas prior exposure to  in vivo  rapamycin rendered T cells refractory to the suppressive effects of  ex vivo  rapamycin. We conclude that rapamycin had paradoxical effects on the pathogenesis of experimental {HDM}-induced asthma. Thus, consistent with the context-dependent effects of rapamycin on inflammation, the timing of {mTOR} inhibition may be an important determinant of efficacy and toxicity in {HDM}-induced asthma.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose

Asthma is characterized by chronic lung inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Despite recent advances in understanding of its pathophysiology, asthma remains a major public health problem, and new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. In this context, we sought to ascertain whether treatment with the {TK} inhibitor dasatinib might repair inflammatory and remodelling processes, thus improving lung function, in a murine model of asthma.


Experimental Approach

Animals were sensitized and subsequently challenged, with ovalbumin ({OVA}) or saline. Twenty-four hours after the last challenge, animals were treated with dasatinib, dexamethasone, or saline, every 12 h for 7 consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, the animals were killed, and data were collected. Lung structure and remodelling were evaluated by morphometric analysis, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy of lung sections. Inflammation was assessed by cytometric analysis and {ELISA}, and lung function was evaluated by invasive whole-body plethysmography.


Key Results

In {OVA} mice, dasatinib, and dexamethasone led to significant reductions in airway hyperresponsiveness. Dasatinib was also able to attenuate alveolar collapse, contraction index, and collagen fibre deposition, as well as increasing elastic fibre content, in {OVA} mice. Concerning the inflammatory process, dasatinib reduced inflammatory cell influx to the airway and lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes, without inducing the thymic atrophy promoted by dexamethasone.


Conclusions and Implications

In this model of allergic asthma, dasatinib effectively blunted the inflammatory and remodelling processes in asthmatic lungs, enhancing airway repair and thus improving lung mechanics.},

Rapamycin is a potent allosteric {mTORC}1 inhibitor with clinical applications as an immunosuppressant and anti-cancer agent. Here we find that Torin1, a highly potent and selective {ATP}-competitive {mTOR} inhibitor that directly inhibits both complexes, impairs cell growth and proliferation to a far greater degree than rapamycin. Surprisingly, these effects are independent of {mTORC}2 inhibition and are instead because of suppression of rapamycin-resistant functions of {mTORC}1 that are necessary for cap-dependent translation and suppression of autophagy. These effects are at least partly mediated by {mTORC}1-dependent and rapamycin-resistant phosphorylation of 4E-{BP}1. Our findings challenge the assumption that rapamycin completely inhibits {mTORC}1 and indicate that direct inhibitors of {mTORC}1 kinase activity may be more successful than rapamycin at inhibiting tumors that depend on {mTORC}1.},

We hypothesized that Hsp90 inhibitors may ameliorate the inflammation and {ALI} associated with severe sepsis., Objectives: To test the hypothesis that Hsp90 inhibitors prolong survival, attenuate inflammation, and reduce lung injury in a murine model of sepsis., Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice received either one of two Hsp90 inhibitors, radicicol or 17-allylaminodemethoxygeldanamycin (17-{AAG}), 24, 12, 6, and 0 hours before receiving a lethal dose of endotoxin (6.75 × 104 endotoxin units/g body weight). Outcomes included survival and parameters of systemic inflammation (plasma neutrophil, cytokine, chemokine, and nitrite/nitrate levels), pulmonary inflammation (lung nuclear factor-κB and myeloperoxidase activities, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, inducible nitric oxide synthase–Hsp90 complex formation, and leukocyte infiltration), and lung injury (pulmonary capillary leak and lung function)., Measurements and Main Results: Mice pretreated with vehicle and receiving endotoxin exhibited 100\% 24-hour lethality, a dramatic increase in all parameters of systemic and pulmonary inflammation, increased capillary leak, and reduced lung function. Compared with them, mice receiving either radicicol or 17-{AAG} before endotoxin exhibited prolonged survival, reduced or abolished increases in systemic and pulmonary inflammatory parameters, attenuated capillary leak, and restored, normal lung function., Conclusions: Hsp90 inhibitors may offer a new pharmacological tool in the management of severe sepsis and severe sepsis–induced {ALI}.},

	abstract = {Aims Heat shock protein 90 ({HSP}90) is a ubiquitous chaperone involved in the folding, activation, and assembly of many proteins. {HSP}90 inhibitors [17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldamycin (17-{AAG})/17-dimethyl aminothylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin hydrochloride (17-{DMAG})] bind to and inactivate {HSP}90, increasing the heat shock response and suppressing different signalling pathways. We aim to investigate the effect of {HSP}90 inhibitors in the modulation of inflammatory responses during atherogenesis.Methods and results In human atherosclerotic plaques, {HSP}90 immunostaining was increased in inflammatory regions and in plaques characterized by lower cap thickness. In cultured human macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells, treatment with either 17-{AAG} or 17-{DMAG} increased {HSP}70 expression and reduced transcription factor [signal transducers and activators of transcription ({STAT}) and nuclear factor-κB ({NF}-κB)] activation and chemokine expression induced by proinflammatory cytokines. In vivo, hyperlipidaemic {ApoE}−/− mice were randomized to 17-{DMAG} (2 mg/kg every 2 days, n = 11) or vehicle injected (n = 9) during 10 weeks. Atherosclerotic plaques of mice treated with 17-{DMAG} displayed increased {HSP}70 expression and diminished {NF}-κB and {STAT} activation, along with decreased lesion, lipid, and macrophage content, compared with vehicle-injected mice. In addition, treatment with 17-{DMAG} significantly reduced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels, both in plaques and in plasma.Conclusion {HSP}90 expression is associated with features of plaque instability in advanced human lesions. {HSP}90 inhibitors reduce inflammatory responses in atherosclerosis, suggesting that {HSP}90 could be a novel therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.},

	abstract = {Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase ({COX}) have been identified in eukaryotic cells: a constitutively expressed {COX}-1 and mitogen-inducible {COX}-2, which is selectively expressed in response to various inflammatory stimuli. Thus, {COX}-2 instead of {COX}-1 is implicated to produce prostanoids mediating inflammatory responses. Major efforts have been focused on identifying nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ({NSAIDS}) which can selectively inhibit the enzyme activity of {COX}-2. Such {NSAIDS} would be more desirable anti-inflammatory agents in comparison to {NSAIDS} which inhibit both {COX}-1 and {COX}-2. Other than glucocorticoids, pharmacological agents which can selectively suppress the expression of {COX}-2 without affecting that of {COX}-1 have not been identified. We report here that radicicol, a fungal antibiotic, is a potent protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and that it inhibits the expression of {COX}-2 without affecting {COX}-1 expression in lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-stimulated macrophages with the {IC}50 value of 27 {nM}. Radicicol inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of p53/56lyn, a Src family tyrosine kinase and one of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in {LPS}-stimulated macrophages. Radicicol also inhibited {COX}-2 expression in vivo in glomeruli of rats with experimental glomerulonephritis induced by the anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, in which {COX}-2 expression is known to be enhanced. The enzyme activity of {COX}-1 or {COX}-2 was not affected by radicicol in macrophages. Radicicol also suppressed the {COX}-2 expression induced by {IL}-1β in rat smooth muscle cells. Other protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors suppressed the {LPS}-induced {COX}-2 expression in macrophages but at much higher concentrations than needed for radicicol. Radicicol did not inhibit the {COX}-2 expression induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in macrophages. These results suggest that the activation of tyrosine-specific protein kinases is the proximal obligatory step in the {LPS}-induced signal transduction pathway leading to the induction of {COX}-2 expression in macrophages. The magnitude of the inhibition of {COX}-2 protein synthesis by radicicol was much greater than that of the steady state levels of {COX}-2 {mRNA}. These results suggest that radicicol inhibits {COX}-2 expression mainly at post-transcriptional steps.},

	abstract = {Background. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are widely discussed in the literature. Not much is known about the possible overdiagnosis and consequently the overtreatment with inhaled corticosteroids ({ICS}).
Aim. This study investigates how often {ICS} are prescribed without a proper indication and how big the diagnostic problem is caused by inappropriate prescription and use of {ICS}.
Methods. All patients referred to a primary care diagnostic centre during 6 months who used {ICS} without a clear indication were included. Their {GPs} were questioned about the reasons for prescribing {ICS}. If still no diagnosis could be assessed, {GPs} were advised to stop {ICS} and renew spirometry after a steroid-free period of at least 3 months. After 1 year, the use of {ICS} was evaluated and the diagnoses were reassessed.
Results. Of all referred patients (2271), 1171 used {ICS}, 505 (30\%) without a clear indication. After 1 year, final results showed that 11\% of all patients originally using {ICS} had no indication to use {ICS} and had successfully ceased using this mediation. For 15\%, the reasons for using {ICS} remained unclear.
Conclusions. Overtreatment with {ICS} in primary care seems to be considerable, which falsely labels patients as asthmatic and which generates unnecessary costs and possible side effects. The awareness of {GPs} of the need for proper diagnostic testing before prescribing {ICS} needs to be improved. Overtreatment with {ICS} in primary care patients can be diminished by systematically supporting the {GP} in the diagnostic procedures and decision making.},

	abstract = {Incomplete β-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria is a feature of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Previous studies revealed that plasma concentrations of medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines (by-products of incomplete β-oxidation) are elevated in T2DM and insulin resistance. In a previous study, we reported that mixed d,l isomers of C12- or C14-carnitine induced an {NF}-κB-luciferase reporter gene in {RAW} 264.7 cells, suggesting potential activation of proinflammatory pathways. Here, we determined whether the physiologically relevant l-acylcarnitines activate classical proinflammatory signaling pathways and if these outcomes involve pattern recognition receptor ({PRR})-associated pathways. Acylcarnitines induced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in a chain length-dependent manner in {RAW} 264.7 cells. l-C14 carnitine (5–25 μM), used as a representative acylcarnitine, stimulated the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, l-C14 carnitine induced phosphorylation of {JNK} and {ERK}, common downstream components of many proinflammatory signaling pathways including {PRRs}. Knockdown of {MyD}88, a key cofactor in {PRR} signaling and inflammation, blunted the proinflammatory effects of acylcarnitine. While these results point to potential involvement of {PRRs}, l-C14 carnitine promoted {IL}-8 secretion from human epithelial cells ({HCT}-116) lacking Toll-like receptors ({TLR})2 and -4, and did not activate reporter constructs in {TLR} overexpression cell models. Thus, acylcarnitines have the potential to activate inflammation, but the specific molecular and tissue target(s) involved remain to be identified.},

	abstract = {Endometriosis is a complex, polygenic, and estrogen-dependent disease that affects 6\% to 10\% of women of reproductive age, and 30\% to 50\% of women with infertility and/or pelvic pain. Surgical diagnosis of endometriosis is still the gold standard, as there are currently no diagnostic biomarkers available. Due to the invasive diagnostics, it can take up to 11 years before affected women are diagnosed and receive the appropriate treatment. We performed a targeted metabolomics study to search for potential semi-invasive biomarkers in peritoneal fluid from endometriosis patients. Our case-control study comprised 29 ovarian endometriosis patients and 36 healthy control women. The 148 metabolites included acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids, which were quantified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The strength of association between the metabolites and the metabolite ratios and disease was assessed using crude and adjusted odds ratios. The best combination of biomarkers was then selected by performing step-wise logistic regression. Our analysis reveals significantly decreased concentrations of 10 metabolites, of carnitine and acylcarnitines (C0, C8:1, C6C4:1 {DC}, C10:1), phosphatidylcholines ({PC} aa C38:3, {PC} aa C38:4, {PC} aa C40:4, {PC} aa C40:5), and sphingomyelins ({SM} C16:1, {SM} C18:1), and 125 significantly altered metabolite ratios in patients versus control women. The best model includes two ratios: a carnitine to a phosphatidylcholine (C0/{PC} ae C36:0); and between two phosphatidylcholines ({PC} aa C30:0/{PC} ae C32:2). When adjusted for age, this provides sensitivity of 82.8\% and specificity of 94.4\%, with {AUC} of 0.944. Our study supports the importance of carnitine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin metabolites in the pathophysiology of endometriosis, and confirms the potential for the combination of individual metabolite ratios to provide biomarkers for semi-invasive diagnostics.},

Building on our experience with the gene set analysis toolkit {GeneTrail}, we implemented the {miRNA} Enrichment Analysis and Annotation tool ({miEAA}). {MiEAA} is a web-based application that offers a variety of commonly applied statistical tests such as over-representation analysis and {miRNA} set enrichment analysis, which is similar to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Besides the different statistical tests, {miEAA} also provides rich functionality in terms of {miRNA} categories. Altogether, over 14 000 {miRNA} sets have been added, including pathways, diseases, organs and target genes. Importantly, our tool can be applied for {miRNA} precursors as well as mature {miRNAs}. To make the tool as useful as possible we additionally implemented supporting tools such as converters between different {miRBase} versions and converters from {miRNA} names to precursor names. We evaluated the performance of {miEAA} on two sets of {miRNAs} that are affected in lung adenocarcinomas and have been detected by array analysis.

	abstract = {The physiological role of glucagon-like peptide-1 7-36 amide ({GLP}-1 7-36) in man was investigated. {GLP}-1 7-36-like immunoreactivity was found in the human bowel; its circulating level rose after oral glucose and after a test breakfast. When it was infused into seven volunteers at a rate to mimic its postprandial plasma concentration in the fasting state, plasma insulin levels rose significantly and glucose and glucagon concentrations fell. During an intravenous glucose load, it greatly enhanced insulin release and significantly reduced peak plasma glucose concentrations, compared with a control saline infusion, even inducing postinfusion reactive hypoglycaemia. By comparison, infusion of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ({GIP}) to physiological levels was less effective in stimulating insulin release. These observations suggest that {GLP}-1 7-36 is a physiological incretin and that it is more powerful than {GIP}. The observation of greatly increased postprandial plasma {GLP}-1 7-36 levels in patients with postgastrectomy dumping syndrome suggests that it may mediate the hyperinsulinaemia and reactive hypoglycaemia of this disorder.},

	abstract = {To find mammalian analogues of exendin-4, a peptide from Helodermatidae venoms that interacts with newly discovered exendin receptors on dispersed acini from guinea pig pancreas, we examined the actions of recent additions to the vasoactive intestinal peptide/secretin/glucagon family of regulatory peptides. In every respect tested, the truncated form of glucagon-like peptide-1, {GLP}-1(7-36){NH}2, mimicked the actions of exendin-4. Like exendin-4, {GLP}-1(7-36){NH}2 caused an increase in acinar {cAMP} without stimulating amylase release. {GLP}-1(7-36){NH}2-induced increases in {cAMP} were inhibited progressively by increasing concentrations of the specific exendin-receptor antagonist, exendin(9-39){NH}2. In dispersed acini from guinea pig and rat pancreas, concentrations of {GLP}-1(7-36){NH}2 that stimulated increases in {cAMP} caused potentiation of cholecystokinin-induced amylase release. Binding of 125I-[Y39]exendin-4 or 125I-{GLP}-1(7-36){NH}2 to dispersed acini from guinea pig pancreas was inhibited by adding increasing concentrations of unlabeled exendin-4 or {GLP}-1(7-36){NH}2. We conclude that the mammalian peptide {GLP}-1(7-36){NH}2 interacts with exendin receptors on dispersed acini from guinea pig pancreas. Exendin(9-39){NH}2, a competitive antagonist of the actions of {GLP}-1(7-36){NH}2 in pancreatic acini, may be a useful tool for examining the physiological actions of this peptide.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Dulaglutide and liraglutide, both glucagon-like peptide-1 ({GLP}-1) receptor agonists, improve glycaemic control and reduce weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a head-to-head trial, we compared the safety and efficacy of once-weekly dulaglutide with that of once-daily liraglutide in metformin-treated patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.
{METHODS}: We did a phase 3, randomised, open-label, parallel-group study at 62 sites in nine countries between June 20, 2012, and Nov 25, 2013. Patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes receiving metformin (≥1500 mg/day), aged 18 years or older, with glycated haemoglobin ({HbA}1c) 7·0\% or greater (≥53 mmol/mol) and 10·0\% or lower (≤86 mmol/mol), and body-mass index 45 kg/m(2) or lower were randomly assigned to receive once-weekly dulaglutide (1·5 mg) or once-daily liraglutide (1·8 mg). Randomisation was done according to a computer-generated random sequence with an interactive voice response system. Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was non-inferiority (margin 0·4\%) of dulaglutide compared with liraglutide for change in {HbA}1c (least-squares mean change from baseline) at 26 weeks. Safety data were collected for a further 4 weeks' follow-up. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}01624259.
{FINDINGS}: We randomly assigned 599 patients to receive once-weekly dulaglutide (299 patients) or once-daily liraglutide (300 patients). 269 participants in each group completed treatment at week 26. Least-squares mean reduction in {HbA}1c was -1·42\% ({SE} 0·05) in the dulaglutide group and -1·36\% (0·05) in the liraglutide group. Mean treatment difference in {HbA}1c was -0·06\% (95\% {CI} -0·19 to 0·07, pnon-inferiority{\textless}0·0001) between the two groups. The most common gastrointestinal adverse events were nausea (61 [20\%] in dulaglutide group vs 54 [18\%] in liraglutide group), diarrhoea (36 [12\%] vs 36 [12\%]), dyspepsia (24 [8\%] vs 18 [6\%]), and vomiting (21 [7\%] vs 25 [8\%]), with similar rates of study or study drug discontinuation because of adverse events between the two groups (18 [6\%] in each group). The hypoglycaemia rate was 0·34 ({SE} 1·44) and 0·52 (3·01) events per patient per year, respectively, and no severe hypoglycaemia was reported.
{INTERPRETATION}: Once-weekly dulaglutide is non-inferior to once-daily liraglutide for least-squares mean reduction in {HbA}1c, with a similar safety and tolerability profile.

Several high-throughput technologies have been used to map out which proteins are expressed in which tissues; however, the data have not previously been systematically compared and integrated. We present a comprehensive evaluation of tissue expression data from a variety of experimental techniques and show that these agree surprisingly well with each other and with results from literature curation and text mining. We further found that most datasets support the assumed but not demonstrated distinction between tissue-specific and ubiquitous expression. By developing comparable confidence scores for all types of evidence, we show that it is possible to improve both quality and coverage by combining the datasets. To facilitate use and visualization of our work, we have developed the {TISSUES} resource (http://tissues.jensenlab.org), which makes all the scored and integrated data available through a single user-friendly web interface.},
